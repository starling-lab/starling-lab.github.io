My research focuses on developing generative models that combine expressive deep learning representations with tractable probabilistic inference. A key contribution is [Probabilistic Flow Circuits (PFCs)](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=1oE7YizXHf), introduced in my UAI 2023 paper, which unify probabilistic circuits with normalizing flows. This framework retains the flexibility of deep generative models while enabling exact inference, making it well-suited for density estimation, structured generation, and uncertainty quantification. Additionally, my IJCAI 2024 survey on [building expressive and tractable generative models](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.24963/ijcai.2024/910) provides a comprehensive outline of the field for understanding the trade-offs between expressivity, tractability, and learning efficiency. It explores how hybrid models—such as deep-learning-enhanced probabilistic circuits—address fundamental challenges in generative modeling, paving the way for more efficient and interpretable AI systems.
