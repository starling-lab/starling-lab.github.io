Our paper titled "On the Robustness and Reliability of Late Multi-Modal Fusion using Probabilistic Circuits" has been accepted to the 27th International Conference on Information Fusion (FUSION) 2024! This work investigates the robustness of Probabilistic Circuits (PCs) as fusion functions in scenarios with missing and noisy data; particularly by examining the impact of PCs on the calibration and reliability of the resulting classifiers.
