Our paper titled "Modeling multiple adverse pregnancy outcomes: Learning from diverse data sources" has been accepted to the International Conference in Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (AIME) 2024!  This work considers the problem of modeling adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs) from diverse data sets and aims to understand what is common between them and what is unique for each of these data sets. The paper can be accessed from [here](/assets/pdfs/Modeling_multiple_APOs.pdf).

Congratulations to all the authors!
