Our paper titled "Combining Planning and Reinforcement Learning for Solving Relational Multiagent Domains" has been accepted to the 24th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS) 2025! This work focuses on sequential-decision making in Multiagent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) which is challenging because of several issues like the curse of dimensionality, non-stationarity of the environment and credit assignment, thus, introduces a novel framework MaRePReL (Multiagent Relational Planning and Reinforcement Learning) that is designed to address these challenges by integrating hierarchical relational planning with reinforcement learning.
