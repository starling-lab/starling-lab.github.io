Our paper titled "A Unified Framework for Human-Allied Learning of Probabilistic Circuits" has been accepted to the 39th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) 2025! This work proposes a novel unified framework that can systematically integrate diverse domain knowledge into the parameter learning process of PCs. Such knowledge-intensive learning is particularly useful in datascarce/knowledge-rich domains such as healthcare.
