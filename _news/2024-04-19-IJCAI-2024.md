Our paper titled "Building Expressive and Tractable Probabilistic Generative Models: A Review" has been accepted to the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI) 2024 survey track!  This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the advancements and techniques in the field of tractable probabilistic generative modeling, primarily focusing on Probabilistic Circuits (PCs). The paper can be accessed from [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.00759.pdf).

Congratulations to Sahil for this amazing survey paper!
