Our paper titled "Human-in-the-loop or AI-in-the-loop? Automate or Collaborate?" has been accepted to the 39th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) 2025! This paper argues that existing evaluation methods for Human-in-the-loop (HIL) systems often overemphasize the machine (learning) component’s performance, neglecting the human expert’s critical role. Consequently, proposes an AI2L perspective, which recognizes that the human expert is an active participant in the system, significantly influencing its overall performance and faithfully modeling the intricate interplay between the human and machine components, leading to more effective and robust AI systems.
