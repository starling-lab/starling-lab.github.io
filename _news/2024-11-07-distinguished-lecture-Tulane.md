Professor Sriraam Natarajan gave a distinguished lecture on “Enhancing healthcare with AI-in-the-loop” at Tulane University on November 7th. He focused on learning models that use rich representations to model the domain, which potentially allows for seamless human interaction, where human input is taken as "advice" and the learning algorithm combines this advice with data. He presented recent progress in these algorithms in the context of several healthcare problems — learning from electronic health records, clinical studies, and surveys — and demonstrated the value of involving experts during the learning process.
